## Oauth Google

This is a repository for a dotnet application for make Oauth connection with the **Google API**.
In this repository you'll only find out a backend part made in dotnet, so you can run this using the
**dotnet run** in your terminal or cmd. After this you need to call the endpoint in your browser, if you do not change anything you can call this on you brownser: http://localhost:5000/authentication/login/signingoogle. As said before this is only backend so if you want to logout your account of the authentication you can call : http://localhost:5000/authentication/login/logout.
